/**
 * This penalty term is used to ensure that the transformation from
 * cm-rep parameter space to physical space is diffeomorphic. It uses
 * somewhat of a brute-force approach: test no boundary point in the 
 * model lies inside one of the spheres (M, R) on the medial axis. I 
 * don't currently have a formal proof, but I believe that if this 
 * condition is satisified, we can guarantee that the model is Blum.
 *
 * This is an O(n^2) algorithm, which is unfortunate, but the computation
 * involved in evaluation and gradient computation is reasonably fast, since
 * it does not involve any expensive operations, just some multiplications
 * and additions. 
 *
 * It also is possible to speed up the computation using a kd-tree or a
 * similar algorithm. However, it's not clear just how much of a boost
 * we would be able to get that way. Anyway, something we can figure out
 * later in the game
